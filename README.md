# Java Full-Stack Challenge

Welcome to the Java Full-Stack challenge. Here you will find a basic project
that works, can be built successfully. However, there are a set of improvements
that can be made. Some of them will be easily identified, but not all.

## What do you need to run this project

Basically, all you need to run is `git` and a `Java 17 compiler`. Git is frequently 
the choice to handling source code version control, so it's very important that
you feel comfortable working with it. And for this challenge, we're using Java
because Java can provide a set of tooling to get services and APIs up and running
quickly.

- For `git` you can [download it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- And for `Java` we recommend **SDK Man**, based on its simplicity. Please, take
a look [here to learn how to install](https://sdkman.io/install)

### Getting started

Once you cloned this repository and installed Java, you can run it with
`./mvn spring-boot:run` in the project root directory. This will start the 
service, you can check for success at your browser heading to
http://localhost:8090/health-check. You should see a "OK" word.

You can check the Front-End example app heading to http://localhost:8090
